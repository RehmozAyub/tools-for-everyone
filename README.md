# tools-for-everyone
Some tools I made to make life easier.

All of these tools are completely free for you to use and run for your own benefit.
I believe technology should be shared for good and productive purposes, so everyone can benefit!

Some of these tools require a .env file for configuration, which you can easily create yourself.

If you have any questions, need help, or want to share your experience, feel free to reach out to me.
